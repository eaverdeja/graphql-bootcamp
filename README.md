# GraphQL Bootcamp

## Things I Learned

I'll use this `README` to document stuff I learned while working on the [GraphQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-bootcamp) course at Udemy.

> Obviously, a lot of details are left out since I already knew some of the topics covered. If you want those, get the course on Udemy. It's good üëç

## Tools used so far

Eventually I'll collect all (or most of the) tools used in the course in this list, with a short and objective description of each:

- uuid
- nodemon
- babel
- graphql yoga
- prisma
  - prisma-binding
- graphql playground
- graphql cli
- jsonwebtoken
- env-cmd
- heroku

## Modules

The course is outlined in a few different modules. I've created separate branches so each module could be outlined. Each of the branches have a dedicated README with the lessons learned throughout the module:

- [GraphQL Basics (incomplete)](https://github.com/eaverdeja/graphql-bootcamp/tree/module/graphql-basics#graphql-bootcamp)
- [Database Layer](https://github.com/eaverdeja/graphql-bootcamp/tree/module/prisma#graphql-bootcamp---database-layer)
- [Authentication](https://github.com/eaverdeja/graphql-bootcamp/tree/module/authentication#graphql-bootcamp---authentication)
- [Pagination & Sorting](https://github.com/eaverdeja/graphql-bootcamp/tree/module/pagination-and-sorting#graphql-bootcamp---pagination-and-sorting)
- [Production Deployment](https://github.com/eaverdeja/graphql-bootcamp/tree/module/production-deployment#graphql-bootcamp---production-deployment)
