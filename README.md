# GraphQL Bootcamp

## Things I Learned

I'll use this `README` to document stuff I learned while working on the [GraphQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-bootcamp) course at Udemy.

## Tools used so far

Eventually I'll collect all (or most of the) tools used in the course in this list, with a short and objective description of each:

- uuid
- nodemon
- babel
- graphql yoga
- prisma
- graphql playground

  comments: [Comment!]!
## Modules

The course is outlined in a few different modules. I'll stick to the same separation whenever possible throughout this `README`

### Warm Up

- [Babel - Try it out](https://babeljs.io/repl)
    - We can tinker with the babel config straight from the browser!

### GraphQL Basics

- TODO

### Database layer

#### Postgres

- PgAdmin3 is not supported anymore for Ubuntu, so I tried going for pgAdmin4. The manual install seemed a bit cumbersome, so I went looking for a Docker solution. I found this small guide by Renato Groffe (valeu Renato! üëç) for spinning up Docker containers for `postgres` and for `pgAdmin4`. He even put a sweet `docker-compose.yml`!
    - *The articles are in portuguese*
    - [Postgres & Docker](https://medium.com/@renato.groffe/postgresql-docker-executando-uma-inst%C3%A2ncia-e-o-pgadmin-4-a-partir-de-containers-ad783e85b1a4)
    - [Creating a docker-compose file for Postgres & PgAdmin4](https://medium.com/@renato.groffe/postgresql-pgadmin-4-docker-compose-montando-rapidamente-um-ambiente-para-uso-55a2ab230b89)
    - The resulting compose file looks like this:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.27
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        # uncomment the next line and provide the env var PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET=my-secret to activate cluster security
        # managementApiSecret: my-secret
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: # host
            database: # name
            user: # user
            password: # password
            rawAccess: true
            port: '5432'
            migrations: true
            ssl: true
            
  postgres-compose:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "Postgres2019!" # default postgres password
    ports:
      - "15432:5432"
    volumes:
      - /~/Projects/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - postgres-compose-network
      
  pgadmin-compose:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: # your email
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "PgAdmin2019!" #pgadmin default password
    ports:
      - "16543:80"
    depends_on:
      - postgres-compose
    networks:
      - postgres-compose-network

```

#### Prisma

##### Database agnostic

With Prisma, we can use multiple databases in the same request! Currently, there is support for MySQL, Postgres, Amazon RDS and MongoDB. ElasticSearch, neo4j, Cassandra and Amazon DynamoDB are on their roadmap.

##### Service abstraction

Prisma hides the database implementation details from us. The same datamodel should always yield the same schema, no matter the database driver(s) used. That's pretty cool! It's making me more prone to look into another DB vendor, seeing as I've never messed with postgres before.

##### Migrations

The current of workflow of changing the `datamodel.prisma` will probably be affected by [official migration support by Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/rfcs/blob/migrations/text/0000-migrations.md). The [motivation](https://github.com/prisma/rfcs/blob/migrations/text/0000-migrations.md#motivation) section is clear and straight to the point. The new spec aims to be more explicit, having the `cli` generate editable migration files and using those as a source of truth instead of using the actual schema.

Personally it seems like a good idea to strike balance between declarative and imperative paradigms since declarative tools can get pretty magic ‚ú® pretty fast üèé. For example, not knowing the **actual** database changes, I have to trust Prisma as a user that all will go well. With migrations support, I could see that adding a `@unique` directive to a field would give me a unique index on postgres.

##### Nested mutations

We can easily do cool stuff like the query below straight from GraphQL Playground:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    name: "Jack"
    email: "jack@gmail.com"
    comments: {
      create: {
        text: "Creating a nested comment on an existing post!"
        post: {
          connect: {
            id: "cjsuc6g1k0eno079020fs4dng"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
    name
    email
    comments {
      text
      post {
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Just by defining simple relations between the `User`, `Comment` and `Post` types, Prisma exposed some pretty handy **input types** (as in `createUser(data: {...}`). It looks like this:

```graphql
input UserCreateInput {
  name: String!
  email: String!
  posts: PostCreateManyWithoutAuthorInput # We are NOT using this one in the example
  comments: CommentCreateManyWithoutAuthorInput 
}

input CommentCreateManyWithoutAuthorInput {
  create: [CommentCreateWithoutAuthorInput!] # We are using this one in the example
  connect: [CommentWhereUniqueInput!]
}

input CommentCreateWithoutAuthorInput {
  text: String!
  post: PostCreateOneInput!
}

input PostCreateOneInput {
  create: PostCreateInput
  connect: PostWhereUniqueInput # We are using this one in the example
}

input PostWhereUniqueInput {
  id: ID
}

```

At the same time we are **creating a user**, we are **creating a comment** attached to an **existing post**. Having that kind of operation resumed in a query is very powerful for clients of the API. Sweet!

These input types are available throughtout the API:

```graphql
mutation {
  createComment(data: {
    author: {
      connect: {
        email: "jack@gmail.com"
      }
    }
    post: {
      connect: {
        id: "cjsuc6g1k0eno079020fs4dng"
      }
    }
    text: "Creating a comment for an existing user on an existing post!"
  }) {
    id
    text
    author {
      name
    }
    post {
      title
    }
  }
}
```
Here we're creating a comment while connecting it to an existing user and an existing post. I was surprised to see that the `email` field on the `User` type was added as an option to `connect` other than the id, seeing as it used the `@unique` directive in the datamodel definition:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  email: String! @unique
  ...
}

type Comment {
  author: User!
  ...
}

input CommentCreateInput {
  text: String!
  author: UserCreateOneWithoutCommentsInput!
  post: PostCreateOneInput!
}

input UserCreateOneWithoutCommentsInput {
  create: UserCreateWithoutCommentsInput
  connect: UserWhereUniqueInput
}

input UserWhereUniqueInput {
  id: ID
  email: String
}
```
